# GeorgeChampBot

GeorgeChampBot, a multi-purpose discord bot

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project, install [git](https://git-scm.com/), and then run the following command in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/george-xiao/GeorgeChampBot.git
```

Change your directory in the terminal to the cloned project:

```
cd your/path/here
```

Completely fill out all fields in the `.env` file. This will require you to set up the following:
 - a [Discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), 
 - [Twitch Authentication Key](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/),
 - [YouTube Authentication Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) and
 - Dedicated [server channels and roles](https://discord.com/blog/starting-your-first-discord-server)

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) based on the platform the bot will run on.

Give the `run.sh` script permission to execute by running the following command in the terminal.

```
chmod +x run.sh
```

Finally, start the application using the `run.sh` script. Note that only this step is needed to start the bot on subsequent runs.

```
./run.sh
```

## Run Manually

To run the bot directly on your local machine, the additional dependencies have to be installed (on top the ones installed in [Getting Started](#getting-started)).

```
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Use the following command to start the bot:

```
python3 GeorgeChampBot.py
```
